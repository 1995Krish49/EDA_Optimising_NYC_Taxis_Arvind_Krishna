This repository contains an in-depth exploratory data analysis using 2023 NYC Yellow Taxi data, focusing on operational efficiency and demand-driven insights. Key outcomes include:

Peak Demand & Deployment Strategy: Identified high-demand zones (e.g., JFK, East Elmhurst, nightlife districts) and busiest hours (14:00–19:00, Tue–Thu) to inform dynamic dispatch strategies.

Zone & Fleet Allocation: Analyzed drop-off/pick-up ratios to balance supply, recommended optimized fleet compositions (e.g., larger vehicles in group-travel zones, small cars elsewhere), and suggested monthly/seasonal adjustments.

Revenue-Driven Pricing Tactics: Built pricing models with dynamic surge recommendations, vendor-specific fare analysis for short trips, and group/incentive structures to maximize profitability.

All code is developed in Python (Pandas, GeoPandas, Seaborn) with interactive visualizations delivered via Power BI. The insights are actionable, targeted at reducing idle time, optimizing dispatching, and improving overall revenue performance.
